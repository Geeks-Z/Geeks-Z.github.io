## 🏛️ National Network Management Platform for Major Scientific Research Infrastructures and Large-scale Scientific Instruments

<div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

**Project Type**: Major Special Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology

**Role**: Student Lead

**Project Link**: [https://nrii.org.cn/](https://nrii.org.cn/)

### Project Overview

In recent years, China's scientific research facilities and instruments have continued to grow in scale, but problems such as low utilization rate, redundant construction, and idle waste are prominent. To improve resource utilization efficiency and service potential, the State Council issued "Opinions on Opening National Major Scientific Research Infrastructures and Large-scale Scientific Instruments to the Public".

**Platform Scale**:
- 📊 Over **600 types** and **100,000+ sets** of facilities and instruments
- 💰 Total value of approximately **160 billion** RMB
- 🏢 Integrated **31 provinces and cities**, **25 departments**
- 🏫 Nearly **5,000 institutions'** platform systems
- 👥 Nearly **8 million** annual visits

### Main Responsibilities

1. Conducted system integration and data verification
2. Completed front-end and back-end platform upgrades
3. Assisted in coordinating technical solutions and personnel arrangements
4. Completed business/technical documentation and contract signing

<div style="background-color: #f0f8e8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

**Project Type**: Major Special Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology

**Role**: Student Lead

**Project Link**: [https://sg.nrii.org.cn/](https://sg.nrii.org.cn/)

### Project Overview

The Large-scale Scientific Instrument Procurement System is the unified channel for procurement units to apply for instrument procurement on the National Network Management Platform. It serves as the data source for the deduplication review system and is a powerful tool for the Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Finance to manage instrument procurement.

### Main Responsibilities

1. Developed system design using **Vue + SpringBoot** front-end and back-end separation architecture
2. Coordinated personnel arrangements, communicated with clients, and controlled project progress
3. Completed business/technical documentation and contract signing

## 🚁 UAV Intelligent Inspection Key Technologies and 3D Platform Application

<div style="background-color: #fff8e8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

**Role**: Student Lead

### Project Overview

This project uses airborne LiDAR to complete high-precision holographic digital modeling of power lines and towers in Jiangsu Province. Based on 3D point cloud data, real-time centimeter-level trajectory planning for multi-rotor UAV power tower inspection is achieved. Finally, a complete power tower inspection system is developed to achieve digital, automated, and refined inspection.

### Main Responsibilities

1. Based on 3D point cloud data, combined with UAV hovering accuracy, implemented flight space grid modeling through ArcGIS interface
2. Constructed objective functions for minimum energy consumption and minimum lighting cost, considering natural wind and lighting effects
3. Improved ant colony and A* hybrid algorithm to solve real-time path planning under different times/wind directions

### Technical Highlights

- ⏱️ Path planning time reduced by **96.6%** compared to traditional A* algorithm
- 📍 Achieved centimeter-level trajectory accuracy
- 🌬️ Real-time planning considering natural wind constraints
