# Hongwei Zhao | 赵宏伟

## Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Software and Theory at the School of Computer Science, Beihang University, advised by Associate Prof. Rui Liu and Prof. Yong Chen. My research focuses on incremental image recognition algorithms in open environments, primarily addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning of deep learning models.

## Research Interests

### 🎯 Incremental Image Recognition in Open Environments (2021.09 - Present)

Designing image recognition models based on **large-scale pre-trained models** to address the challenges of **dynamic and diverse data distributions and modalities** in open environments. The core focus is on developing **continual learning** mechanisms that enable models to incrementally learn new data while effectively retaining stable memory of old knowledge (i.e., solving the **catastrophic forgetting problem**), thereby significantly improving the generalization and adaptability of models in the open world.

**Main Research:**
- Hybrid fine-tuning of PTM based on MoE and LoRA to address Prompt hyperparameters and Adapter computational complexity issues
- Designing multi-teacher distillation strategies based on LoRA to solve catastrophic forgetting and overfitting in few-shot incremental learning
- Designing hierarchical Prompt generators based on LLM to address catastrophic forgetting and zero-shot capabilities in multi-modal incremental learning

### 🚁 UAV Path Planning for General Aviation (2018.09 - 2021.03)

**Main Work:**
- **Accurate modeling to reduce complexity**: Using grid method to map 3D point clouds to matrices for accurate obstacle modeling
- **Minimum energy consumption objective**: Establishing minimum energy consumption objective function, incorporating UAV performance and natural wind constraints
- **Hybrid algorithm for efficiency**: Designed improved ant colony and A* hybrid algorithm, reducing path planning time by 96.6% compared to traditional A*
