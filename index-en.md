# 👋 Welcome to My Academic Homepage!

I am **Hongwei Zhao**, a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science at **Beihang University** (BUAA), advised by Associate Prof. Rui Liu and Prof. Yong Chen.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research focuses on **Incremental Image Recognition in Open Environments**, including:

- **Continual Learning**: Addressing catastrophic forgetting in neural networks
- **Incremental Learning**: Enabling models to learn new data incrementally while retaining old knowledge
- **Large-scale Pre-trained Model Fine-tuning**: Efficient fine-tuning strategies based on MoE, LoRA
- **Multi-modal Learning**: Incremental learning combining vision and language models

## 📰 News

- **2025.01** 🎉 Paper submitted to IJCV (Under Review)
- **2025.01** 🎉 Two papers submitted to ICME 2025 (Under Review)
- **2024.12** 🎉 Paper submitted to Pattern Recognition (Under Review)
- **2024** 🏆 Won the Annual Badminton Championship at Beihang University (2nd consecutive year)
