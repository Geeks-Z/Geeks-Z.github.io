# Hello World - My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! I'm Hongwei Zhao, a Ph.D. candidate at Beihang University.

## About This Blog

This blog is where I share my thoughts on:

- **Research**: Insights and updates on continual learning, incremental learning, and computer vision
- **Technology**: Tutorials and tips on deep learning, PyTorch, and software development
- **Life**: Experiences and reflections from my academic journey

## My Research Focus

My current research focuses on **Class-Incremental Learning (CIL)**, which aims to enable neural networks to learn new classes continuously without forgetting previously learned knowledge. This is a fundamental challenge in machine learning known as **catastrophic forgetting**.

### Key Research Directions

1. **LoRA-based Fine-tuning**: Efficient adaptation of pre-trained models for incremental learning
2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from old models to new ones
3. **Prototype Learning**: Using class prototypes for robust classification
